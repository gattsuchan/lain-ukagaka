//---------------------------Miscellaneous Functions--------------------------

//This .dic file is concerned with a number of functions that didn't quite fit in anywhere else. If you're adding new functions, this may be the place to do it! This also has the functions related to updating your ghost, among others. Most of this will just be replacing placeholder dialogue with dialogue more appropriate for your ghost, and this file is fairly long. On the positive side, you'll probably only have to go through it once.
//Make sure to read the walkthrough page (http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html) for more details about how to properly format ghost dialogue!
//I will reiterate that you should be editing these in Notepad++, and in particular, you should set the Language to C (or Java I guess) to properly highlight all the text. It will make things A LOT EASIER for you, trust me! It will also help you keep track of your brackets in case you forget some. If you click on a line with a bracket in Notepad++, it should highlight where the other bracket ends, or turn purple if there's no finishing bracket (which you should definitely fix!)
//It will also highlight my commented lines in green, so you'll know where they are. Any line beginning with // is a commented line that the code will not read. It's just for your reference!


//--OnFileDrop2

//OnFileDrop2 handles how your ghost will set an image as the desktop background when someone drags and drops an image on them. You don't need to touch any of the coding here, just replace the dialogue as needed and leave the \q options alone. More about \q options in bootend.dic and in the walkthrough.

OnFileDrop2
{
	_filepath = SPLITPATH(reference0)
	_filename = _filepath[2]
	_fileext = TOLOWER(_filepath[3])

		}
		others //Any other file format. As a note here, if you drop something ghost-related on them that does not have an install.txt, then they won't install it and will just say this response. If you are testing your balloon or nar files and you get this response instead of a proper installation, you should check and make sure you have an install.txt in the file!

			"\0\s[0]This is %(_filename)%(_fileext).\e"

 //---- OnInstallBegin -------------------------------------------------------
 //OnInstallBegin is called when a file with an included install.txt is dropped on your ghost. This primarily means things like .nar files for other ghosts or .zip files containing balloons or shells for your ghosts. Primarily ghost-related things. Replace as you want.

	//reference0 in this function refers to the ghost this file is associated with, probably the name of the ghost listed in its install.txt file. You would see this if you dropped a shell made for a different ghost on your current ghost, for example. They can't install a shell for themselves they can't use, right? Anyway, replace this with what you wish, you can use the reference0 envelope or not if you want.
 }


//**** Uninstallation ******************************************
//You may have noticed in the configuration menus in menu.dic an option to turn Uninstall on or off, as well as a greyed out option to uninstall in the right click menu. These following functions relate to the uninstallation process when it's on. Replace the dialogue in each function as we go along.


//--OnVanishSelecting
//When you select the uninstall option in the menu.

OnVanishSelecting
{
	"\0\s[0]The user is deciding whether or not to uninstall us.\w8\1\s[10]If you're testing this, be careful about what you click here, huh?\e"
}

//OnVanishSelected
//When you decide to uninstall them. 

OnVanishSelected
{
	"\0\s[0]The user has decided to uninstall us.\w8\1\s[10]Bye.\w9\w9\e"
}


//--OnVanishCancel
//If you select Uninstall from the menu, but decide not to do it.

OnVanishCancel
{
	"\0\s[0]The user has decided not to uninstall us after all.\e"
}

//--OnVanishButtonHold
//This should trigger if you double click the ghost's balloon in the middle of OnVanishSelected above. So it basically cancels their uninstallation. I'd be pretty careful about testing this, and I'd probably just put the line of dialogue into their script input and test it that way instead.

OnVanishButtonHold
{
	"\1\s[10]This dialogue displays when the user double clicks on the balloon when we're saying we're going to uninstall ourselves.\e"
}


 //---- OnVanished -----------------------------------------
 //OnVanished is a weird little function. Basically, if you uninstall a ghost, it'll automatically go back to the last ghost you were using. They'll then say this line of dialogue about the ghost you just uninstalled. This is very annoying to test as you can imagine! But unlikely to come up super often, I bet. You might as well be thorough and fill this out as well. Make sure to set up both their poses immediately so they both appear when it switches back to them.
 
OnVanished
 {
	"\0\s[0]\1\s[10]%(reference0) has been uninstalled.\w8\0\s[0]Harsh.\e"
	
	//reference0 here is the name of the other ghost.
}


//**** Mail Checking *******************************************************************
//The next set of functions have to do with checking your email. This function is a slippery little thing - I've had people test it following my directions and have it work, but I've never actually gotten it to report back the right amount of emails myself. Very frustrating. But perhaps you'll have more luck with it, haha.
//Girl and Triangle can't actually read your email, they can just tell you how many emails you have. I've seen ghosts that can read the HEADERS of email, but I still don't think ghosts can actually display the contents of an email. You should be using your actual email client for that. It's still kind of a neat feature though.


//*********************Advanced User Info*******************************
//These text boxes are meant for those who have an interest in expanding or using more complicated functions in their ghost. Also for my own reference in the future since I plan on using this template too, haha. If you have no interest in any of this and just want to keep things as simple as possible, feel free to skip these boxes.

//If you want to set up your ghost to check your mail so you can more easily check these messages instead of just writing the dialogue and moving on, it's a little bit tricky, but not super hard.
//Basically, you're going to need to find your POP settings for your email account. Googling your provider + POP should bring it up pretty quick. Once you have the info, you'll go to the right click menu, options, then preferences. A big menu should pop up, and you should see POP in the left side. Click that, and input all the info from the POP page you looked up for your account. Tell your ghost to check your email, and if it works, then congratulations!
//***********************************************************************


 //---- OnBIFFBegin ---------------------------------------------------------------
 //When you first tell the ghost to check your email. An intro statement, if you will. Replace with whatever you like.
 
OnBIFFBegin
 {
	"\0\s[0]This is the starting dialogue for checking email.\e"
	
	"\1\s[10]This is another starting dialogue for checking email.\e"
 }

 
 //---- OnBIFFComplete ---------------------------------------------------------------
 //After they've succeeded in checking your mail, they'll report back with how many new emails you have. Replace the dialogue with whatever would be character appropriate.
 
OnBIFFComplete
 {
	if reference0 == 0 //If you have no new mail.
 	{
 		"\0\s[0]There is no new mail.\e"
	}
	elseif reference0 == 1 //If you have one new email.
 	{
 		"\0\s[0]There is one new email.\e"
	}
	elseif reference0 > 1 && reference0 < 11 //If you have more than one email but less than eleven.
	{
		"\0\s[0]There are %(reference0) emails.\e"
		//reference0 here stores the amount of new email it finds.
	}
	elseif reference0 > 100 //If there are over one hundred new emails.
	{
		"\0\s[0]There are %(reference0) emails unread.\w8\1\s[10]Woah.\e"
	}
 	else //For any other number of emails.
	{
		"\0\s[0]There are %(reference0) emails.\e"
 	}
}

 //---- OnBIFFFailure ---------------------------------------------------------------
 //Various error messages that can happen when your ghost tries to connect to an email account. Replace the dialogue as appropriate.
 
OnBIFFFailure
 {
	if reference0 == "timeout" //If the connection times out.
 	{
 		"\0\s[0]The connection has timed out.\e"
	}
 	elseif reference0 == "kick" //If the account blocks the ghost from accessing it. I think gmail may do this at first to try and protect your account from unapproved applications using it. It gives you the option to change the setting in the warning email they send you about it.
	{
		"\0\s[0]We can't access the account.\e"
 	}
	elseif reference0 == "defect" //If the information put into the POP menu is wrong.
 	{
 		"\0\s[0]The email account was not set up properly.\w8\1\s[10]It can be reset at the POP menu.\w8\![open,configurationdialog]\e"
		
		//Note that this ends with \![open,configurationdialog]. This will open up the preferences menu I described above automatically. More on \! functions in the walkthrough. You can delete the \! tag here if you want to.
	}
 	else //if there's some other kind of error.
	{
		"\0\s[0]We can't connect to the account.\w8\1\s[10]The error returned is '%(reference[0])'.\e"
		
		//reference0 here stores the error message the email server would have given the ghost, hopefully.
 	}
}


 //**** Network Update *****************************************************************
 //The following functions are for the Network Update of your ghost, where it will connect to your website, check for new files, and update itself. This is a handy feature, but tricky to set up. If you have no intention of using Network Update, you can disregard these, but it won't hurt to fill them out anyway just in case. More details about how to set up Network Update are in the walkthrough (http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/).
 
 //Replace the dialogue in the next set of functions as appropriate. You can easily test these messages using the Developer panel. Go to Open at the bottom of it and choose one of the four Update Event options to simulate a Ghost's update process. I highly recommend doing this at LEAST once if you're going to use this feature to make sure it flows well.

 
 //---- OnUpdateBegin -------------------------------------------------------------
 //When you first tell your ghost to update. An introductory statement, like OnBIFFBegin above. Replace or add more dialogue as appropriate. Note that they end with \w8 to give a little breather time.
 
OnUpdateBegin
 {
	"\0\s[0]Starting the update process.\w8\e"
	
	"\1\s[10]Another message for starting the update process.\w8\0\s[0]Hope you read the directions properly.\w8\e"
 }

 //If the ghost finds new files to update with.
 
OnUpdateReady

	reference0++ //makes sure it starts at 1 instead of 0
	
    "\1\s[10]There are %(reference0) new files.\w8\e"
	
	//reference0 here storing the number of new files. You don't have to use it if you don't want to.
 }


//---- OnUpdateComplete -------------------------------------------------------------
//When the ghost has finished the update process.

OnUpdateComplete
 {
	if reference0 == "none" //if the ghost had nothing to update with
 	{
 		"\1\s[10]There are no new files.\e"
		
		"\1\s[10]This is another message about there being no new files to update with.\e"
	}
 	else //if the ghost has updated successfully
	{
		"\1\s[10]Update successful!\e"
 	}

 //Error messages if the update process fails in some way.
 
OnUpdateFailure

 	{
 		"\1\s[10]The update connection has timed out.\e"

 	}
	else //for other errors
 	{
 		"\1\s[10]The update could not be completed.\w8\0\s[0]The error is '%(reference0)'.\e"
	}
 }


 //---- OnUpdate.OnDownloadBegin ------------------------------------------------
 //This dialogue plays when they begin downloading a new file. WARNING: if you have big plans for your ghost and are going to make a lot of new image files for it (like... i do, cough) at some point, you're going to want to make these messages very brief, if you even have them at all. The reason is because the user will see these messages for EVERY individual file that they have to download, and if you have, say, 50 pna files in the queue, they will see this dialogue 50 times. Not only that, but displaying the dialogue takes some time, so it also extends the download process.
 //If you aren't planning on adding a ton of files at any point, or are only intending to update the .dic files which will be at most a handful of files, then you can go ahead and put a short message in here. But if your ghost is going to grow in leaps and bounds as you work on it, try and keep these messages as brief as possible (or again, just make it "" to have there be no message at all) to make the process that much faster for your user.
 
OnUpdate.OnDownloadBegin
 {
 	if "aitalk" _in_ reference0 //this is checking to see what kind of files are being downloaded. In this case, it's looking for files called aitalk in the download queue. If you want to have a specialized bit of dialogue for each type of file, you can expand this with elseifs and by replacing aitalk with whatever file you have in mind. Keep in mind my warning above though.
 	{
 		"\0\s[0]We are going to download more dialogue.\w8\1\s[10]It's in the aitalk file.\e"

	"\1\s[10]This is dialogue for finding a new file.\e"
	
	"\0\s[0]This is another bit of dialogue for finding a new file.\e"
	}
 }

 //---- OnUpdate.OnMD5CompareBegin ---------------------------------------------------
 //This checks the hash value of the files in the directory and the files listed in updates.dau, I believe. It will do this for every file the user downloads, so I again remind you of my warning above! For every file they download, they will have to go through three sets of unique dialogue, and it can get old fast. Not to mention it slows things down a lot. Again, I would recommend keeping this very brief, if not just replacing it with "..." or "" instead.
 
OnUpdate.OnMD5CompareBegin
 {
	"\1\s[10]Checking the MD5 value.\e"

 //---- OnUpdate.OnMD5CompareComplete --------------------------------------------------
 //After they've checked the MD5 value and it matches. See above about the length of this message.
 
OnUpdate.OnMD5CompareComplete

	"\0\s[0]MD5 check good.\e"
}

 //---- OnUpdate.OnMD5CompareFailure ---------------------------------------------------
 //If the MD5 values don't match, meaning if the file is missing or damaged or incomplete in some way. If you follow my Network Update directions carefully, this shouldn't come up very often, but don't be surprised if you run into it every now and then by forgetting a file here or there.
 
OnUpdate.OnMD5CompareFailure
 {
	"\0\s[0]The MD5 values don't match.\w8\e"
 }

 
 
 //**** Headlines and RSS Feeds *********************************************************
 //This section has to do with the RSS feeds option on your ghost. If you drag and drop a url on them, they'll add it to a list you can access via the right-click menu, and they'll tell you the last set of updates for the site. This works best with RSS feeds I think, but you can experiment with other sites to see how it works.
 //The headlines you see under the tab are in the headline folder under your base SSP install. So it'd be SSP\headlines. You should see the folders for each linked headline in there. I've very rarely ever messed with them or used them. Likewise, your RSS feeds you've added will be under SSP\rss and I don't think that option will appear in the headlines/RSS tab until you add an RSS feed to a ghost. If you want to clear your RSS feeds or headlines, just delete either of those two folders.
 

 //---- OnHeadlinesenseBegin -----------------------------------------------------------
 //This dialogue comes up when you select something in your RSS feed as an intro, like the other On[Thing]Begin things we've seen so far. Replace as you need.
 
OnHeadlinesenseBegin
 {
	"\0\s[0]You've selected %(reference0).\e"
 }

 //---- OnHeadlinesense.OnFind --------------------------------------------------------
 //This actually displays the feed. My set-up for it is pretty simple but gets the job done, it just has the name of the feed, a line space, then a list of links. You shouldn't have to edit any of these and I probably wouldn't honestly.
 
OnHeadlinesense.OnFind

 //This is an odd function. As far as I can gather, this is if the headline information gathering was successful, but there's no new information to report. Possibly if none of the feeds have updated? I'm a little fuzzy on this one.
 
OnHeadlinesenseComplete

	//reference0 here supposedly always stores the value no update? Again this isn't hugely clear from what I can see. Anyway, this dialogue has never come up for me while using a ghost, so perhaps someone else who runs into it can offer more clarity. For now, you can leave it as is, or write up something else in here if you like.
 }

 //---- OnHeadlinesenseFailure ---------------------------------------------------------
 //This one is more clearly for when the ghost can't get the information it needs about the RSS feed in question.
 
OnHeadlinesenseFailure

//**** Ghost Creation and Updating ******************************************************
//These next few are related to creating updates2.dau and .nar files for your ghosts. You'll want to at least make a .nar to distribute your ghost, and if you're going to be using Network Update, you'll also want to make updates2.dau as well. It's unlikely that anyone other than you will see these messages, but you should be thorough and replace them anyway.
//Primarily, you will see these messages when you're creating your updates file or updating your ghost.nar file. More on this on the walkthrough page. However, you can drag and drop another ghost's folder onto them and they'll also create a nar for that as well, if for some reason you want to do that.


 //---- OnUpdatedataCreating -----------------------------------------------------------
 //This will begin the creation of the updates2.dau file. Not unlike the other beginning functions you've seen throughout this file. Replace with whatever you like.
 
OnUpdatedataCreating
 {
	"\1\s[10]Creating the updates2.dau file.\e"

 //After the updates2.dau file has been successfully created. Replace with whatever.

 {
	"\0\s[0]Successfully created updates2.dau.\e"
 }

 //---- OnNarCreating ------------------------------------------------------------------
 //Along the same lines, this is when they begin creating a .nar file for your ghost. .nars are the format most ghosts will be in, something similar to a .zip file, and this is the format you'll be distributing your ghost in most likely. Replace the dialogue with whatever you like.

 //This is a function however that you may actually use! Or at least, I often use it when desktop space is at a premium (which it always is on my computer). If you right click the ghost, you can go to Shell Scaling, which lists a number of different percentages. Those are the percentages your ghost can be scaled in size up or down. You can try them out yourself to get an idea of what I mean. I often scale mine down to get them out of the way sometimes. This adds dialogue whenever you change their scale. You don't have to do this if you don't want to, in which case they will just stay silent when you size them up or down. If that's what you want, just delete the whole thing or leave "" instead of any dialogue.
