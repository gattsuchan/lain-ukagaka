# lain ukagaka
 a desktop ghost made in the likeness of serial experiments lain
 

 - code based on the work of http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/   
 - use https://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/troubleshoot.html to debug
 - download SSP http://ssp.shillest.net/ to test

All code is annotated to help the user develop their own little desktop mascot thing. Should be very easy. I am only doing it this way since I haven't done anything similar before, and because it's a readily available resource.
